# 3. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Non-Muslims and Torturing Them

# 3.1 No Discrimination Between the Killings of Muslim and Non-Muslim Citizens

In the preceding pages, we demonstrated in the light of the Qurʾān
and prophetic traditions that Islam is a religion of peace that
guarantees the protection of life, property and honour for all
members of society, without any discrimination on the basis of
caste, colour, race and religion. In this chapter we will establish
that the protection of the life, honour and property of non-Muslim
citizens living in any Islamic state or any non-Muslim country is
a binding duty upon the Muslims in general and the Islamic state
in particular.

On the occasion of his Last Sermon, the Prophet ﷺ said,
guaranteeing the protection of life, property and honour of the
whole humankind,

> ‘Indeed your blood and your property and your honour
are inviolable, like the inviolability of this day of yours
and this month of yours and this land of yours until the
day you meet your Lord’.¹

Therefore, it is completely forbidden to kill anyone unjustly, or
plunder his wealth, or humiliate him or malign his honour.

Following this principle, killing Muslim and non-Muslim
citizens--wherever they reside--is strictly prohibited on the basis
of equality. It is clearly stated in the Qurʾān,

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.²

This verse uses the word ‘person’ [*nafs*], which is a general
expression that gives the verse a broad-based application. So in
other words unjust killing is completely forbidden, no matter
what religion, language or citizenship is held by the victim. This
is a sin as grave as killing the whole of humanity. Therefore, the
killing of non-Muslim citizens living in an Islamic state falls in the
same category.

# 3.2 The Massacre of Civilian Population and Considering it Lawful is an Act of Disbelief

Killing a person is akin to disbelief. Imam Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī,
one of the Imams of *Ahl al-Sunna* in theology, interpreted the
verse:

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.¹

declaring that murder can be an act of disbelief. He wrote:

> Whoever declares lawful the killing of a person whose
killing has been forbidden by God (except when there is a
valid reason), it is as if he considers it lawful to kill all of
humanity. This is because he disbelieves by his declaring
lawful the killing of one whose killing is unlawful, which
is akin to declaring lawful the killing of humanity entire;
because the one who disbelieves in one verse from God’s
Book disbelieves in the whole of it. . . .

> This verse contains another possible angle of
interpretation, and it is as has been said: His murder of
one person entails the same burden [in the Hereafter] as
if he killed humanity entire. Another possible angle of
interpretation is that it is necessary for everyone to make
a collective effort to help and save the peaceful person
from murder. So, when the murderer kills that harmless
soul or attempts to harm it, it is as if he is attempting to
do that to everyone. . . . This indicates that the verse was
revealed as a ruling for the people of disbelief and the
people of Islam together, if they sow corruption in the
earth.² 

In his *al-Lubāb fī ʿulūm al-Kitāb*, Abū Ḥafṣ al-Ḥanbalī
interpreted the Qurʾānic verse, ‘*it is as if he killed all of humanity*’,³
and declared that the murder of one individual is comparable
to the killing of all of humanity, and he quoted the sayings of
different Imams in support of this position.

> Mujāhid said, ‘If someone kills a soul unjustly, he will go to Hell due to that murder, just as he would have gone to Hell if he killed humanity entire’. Qatāda said, ‘God has made the reward for saving it [a life] tremendous and made the burden of sin [for taking a life unjustly] tremendous, too. This means that whoever declares it lawful for himself to kill a Muslim, it is as if he killed all of humanity’. Interpreting the same verse, Al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, ‘This means that he is liable to legal retribution
[*qiṣāṣ*] for killing it [the sinless soul] as would be the
person who killed all of humanity’.

> God says: ‘*Indeed, those who wage war against God and
His Messenger and remain engaged in creating mischief in
the land* [i.e., perpetrate terrorism, robbery and burglary
amongst people], *their punishment is that they should be
slain, or crucified, or their hands and their feet on opposite
sides should be cut off, or that they should be exiled from
the land. That is for them a humiliation in this world, and
for them there is a terrible torment in the Hereafter--except
those who turn to God in repentance before you overpower
them. So, know that God is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful*’.⁴

> The phrase in the verse, ‘*yuhāribūn Allāh*’ (‘*wage war
against God*’), implies that they wage war against the
friends of God. That is the interpretation maintained by
the overwhelming majority of scholars. Al-Zamakhsharī
said, ‘They wage war against the Messenger of God, and
waging war against the Muslims takes the same ruling as
waging war against him’. This verse was revealed about
the brigands [highway robbers: *quṭṭāʿ al-ṭarīq*] amongst
the Muslims, and [this position is held] by most of the
jurists.⁵

> Indeed, God’s statement, ‘*Those who wage war against
God and His Messenger and remain engaged in creating
mischief in the land*’, includes everyone who possesses
these traits, whether he is a Muslim or a disbeliever.
One cannot object or claim that the verse was revealed
regarding [a group] of disbelievers, because the point of
consideration is the generality of its expression, not the
particular circumstance in which it was revealed.⁶ If it is
said that those who wage war [*muḥāribūn*] are those who
join forces and who possess power and target the Muslims
in their lives and wealth, and that they [the scholars]
agree that if these traits are found amongst people of the
desert wastelands--then they are brigands. And if these
traits are adopted by a group residing in cities, al-Awzāʿī,
Mālik, Layth b. Saʿd and al-Shāfiʿī all agree that they,
too, are considered brigands and that the same prescribed
punishment is to be applied against them. They stated
that when their crimes take place in populated areas the
sin is severer. They inferred this from the aforementioned
verse and the generality of its expression, and because it
is a prescribed punishment, and therefore it is no different
from the other prescribed punishments.⁷

# 3.3 The Killing of Non-Muslim Citizens Makes Paradise Forbidden for the Killer

The non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state enjoy the same rights
and safeguards as their Muslim counterparts. The first right
endowed upon them by the Islamic state is that of protection against
external aggression and domestic oppression and encroachments,
so they can live their life peacefully, inwardly and outwardly.


Abū Bakra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Any Muslim who unjustly kills a non-Muslim with whom
there is a peace treaty [*muʿāhad*], God will make Paradise
forbidden for him’.¹

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Anyone who kills a non-Muslim under treaty [*muʿāhad*]
will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its
fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years’.²

Therefore, the one who unjustly murders a non-Muslim citizen
will not approach Paradise; rather, he will be kept away from it by
a distance of forty years. Commenting on this hadith, Anwar Shāh
Kāshmīrī writes in his book *Fayḍ al-Bārī*:

> Regarding his statement a, ‘Anyone who kills a non-
Muslim under treaty [*muʿāhad*] will not smell the
fragrance of Paradise, even though its fragrance can be
smelt at a distance of forty years’, the quintessential
meaning of it, dear brother, can be expressed as such:
You know the gravity of sin for killing a Muslim, for
its odiousness has reached the point of disbelief, and it
necessitates that [the killer abides in Hell] forever. As for
killing a non-Muslim citizen [*muʿāhad*], it is similarly no
small matter, for the one who does it will not smell the
fragrance of Paradise.³

# 3.4 The Unlawfulness of Killing Foreign Delegates and Religious Leaders

Islam teaches peace and tolerance in national and international affairs. According to the teachings of the Qurʾān and hadith, it is forbidden to kill a diplomat hailing from a hostile nation who comes to a Muslim state for the purpose of diplomacy. Many non-Muslim diplomats and delegates would come to the Prophet ﷺ on various occasions and he not only treated them with the
utmost respect, but also instructed his Companions to treat them well. It is even recorded that the representatives of Musaylama the liar, false claimant to prophethood, visited the Prophet ﷺ and confessed to their apostasy, yet the Prophet ﷺ treated them well because they were diplomats.

According to a narration in the *Musnad* of Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal,¹
the *Muṣannaf* of ʿAbd al-Razzāq [al-Ṣanʿānī]² and the *Musnad*
of al-Bazzār,³ it is impermissible to kill either diplomats or their
diplomatic staff.

The aforementioned hadith establishes that safeguarding the
life of diplomats and foreign representatives is the Sunna of the
Prophet ﷺ. ʿAbd Allāh b. Masʿūd ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘It is an established Sunna that ambassadors are not to
be killed’.⁴

This statement of the Messenger of God ﷺ set the precedent in
international law with respect to diplomatic protection. This
further illustrates that all the personnel staffed in an embassy on
diplomatic assignments are entitled to the same treatment, and it
is impermissible to kill them. In recent years in Pakistan and other
parts of the world there have been a number of incidents where
foreign diplomats and engineers have been kidnapped and killed.
Unfortunately, those who commit these actions continue to call
themselves *Mujāhidūn* [those who wage martial jihad] despite the
fact that their actions completely contravene the teachings of the
Prophet ﷺ.

Just as foreign diplomats enjoy sanctity and protection in
Islamic law, so too do non-Muslim religious leaders; it is strictly
forbidden to kill them. ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘When the Messenger of God ﷺ would dispatch his troops 
he would say [to them], “Do not act treacherously, do not
steal the spoils of war, do not disfigure the dead bodies,
and do not kill children and priests”.’⁵

This hadith establishes that, even during times of war--let alone in
normal circumstances--it is impermissible to kill religious leaders.

mentioned by Ibn Rushd in *Bidāyat al-mujtahid*, 1:281.

# 3.5 The Retribution [*Qiṣāṣ*] of Muslims and Non-Muslims is the Same

In Islam, retribution is necessary when someone murders someone
else intentionally, whether the victim is Muslim or non-Muslim;
however, the payment of monetary compensation [*diya*] is
obligatory if it was an accidental killing. God says:

> ‘*And there is a* [guarantee of] *life for you in retribution,
O wise people, so that you may guard* [against bloodshed
and destruction]’.¹

Regarding unintentional killing, God says,

> ‘*Whoever kills a Muslim unintentionally shall* [be liable
to] *free a male or female Muslim and pay blood money,
to be handed over to the heirs of the person slain, unless
they forgo it*’.²

In the former verse, retribution, or the command to kill the
murderer for his crime of murder, has been described. There is
a complete consensus amongst the Muslim community that the
unjust killer should be killed by way of retribution, unless the heirs of the killed pardon the killer. The latter verse mentions
monetary compensation. In Islamic law, if someone accidently and
unintentionally kills someone else, he or she is ordered to pay
blood money to the heirs of the killed.

ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. Baylamānī ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘There was a man from the Muslims who killed a man
from the People of the Book.³ The case was presented
to the Prophet a and he said, “I am most responsible of
all for fulfilling the rights of those under his care [non-Muslim citizens]”. Then he ordered [the killing of the
Muslim killer by way of retribution] and he was killed’.⁴

The Prophet ﷺ explained retribution and monetary compensation
in the following words:

> ‘If someone’s relative is killed, or if one of his extremities
is cut off, he may choose one of three options: he may
retaliate, forgive or receive compensation. But if he
wishes a fourth [something that exceeds the bounds set
by the Shariah], you must hold him back [for God says,]
“*After this, whoever exceeds the limits shall receive a
painful punishment*” [Qurʾān 5:94].’⁵

It is clearly established from these prophetic traditions that
Muslims and non-Muslims share an equal status with respect to
monetary compensation and retribution. According to one report,
ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg)  said,

> ‘If a Muslim kills a Christian, he should be killed in
retribution’.⁶

The Prophet ﷺ also granted non-Muslims the same rights with
regard to monetary compensation. He ﷺ said,

> ‘The blood money for a [peaceful] Jew, a Christian and
every non-Muslim citizen is like that of the Muslim
[i.e., their heirs receive the same amount of monetary
compensation as a Muslim family]’.⁷

Imam Abū Ḥanīfa ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘The blood money for a [peaceful] Jew, Christian or
Zoroastrian is equal to that of a free Muslim’.⁸

Imam Ibn Shihāb al-Zuhrī said,

> ‘During the reigns of Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, ʿUthmān and ʿAlī
![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/106.jpg), the blood money for a non-Muslim citizen was equal
to that of a free Muslim’.⁹

The position of the Ḥanafī school of jurisprudence is that a
Muslim should be killed in retribution for killing a non-Muslim
citizen. This position is supported by the general import of the
texts within the Qurʾān and hadith, which make retribution
obligatory. Muslim and non-Muslim blood shares an equal amount
of inviolability and sanctity, without any discrimination. Imam al-Nakhaʿī, Ibn Abī Laylā, al-Shaʿbī and ʿUthmān al-Battī also share
this view held by the Ḥanafī school.

A doubt may emerge from hearing the saying of the Prophet ﷺ,

>
‘A Muslim is not to be killed in retaliation for murdering
a disbeliever’.¹⁰

So what does it mean? The jurists explained this and said that here
the word ‘disbeliever’ does not imply a peaceful citizen: it signifies
a combatant who is killed. There is to be no retribution in this
case. This is an international law in effect in all countries of the
world and there is no difference of opinion about it.

The great jurist and Qurʾānic exegete, Imam al-Jaṣṣāṣ, stated
that in this hadith, ‘a disbeliever’ means the non-Muslim in a state
of war. It does not mean the non-Muslim who is a citizen of an
Islamic state or a peaceful non-Muslim citizen of a non-Muslim
state.¹¹

# 3.6 The Unlawfulness of Harming a Non-Muslim Citizen out of Revenge

According to the Qurʾān and Sunna, every person is responsible
for his or her actions. According to this rule, only the doer of an
act of injustice is liable to punishment, and no one else can be held
responsible for that. The punishment for his or her crime cannot
be awarded to his or her family, friends or tribe. God says,

> ‘*And whatever* [sin] *each soul earns* [its evil outcome]
*falls back upon it. And no bearer of burden will bear
another’s burden. Then you are to return to your Lord
alone, and He will inform you of that wherein you used
to differ*’.¹

Islam does not allow anyone to punish common people for the
oppressive actions of oppressors. The Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘No man amongst them [the peaceful non-Muslim
citizens] shall be punished as a penalty for the injustice of
a coreligionist’.²

All of this clearly demonstrates that those who seek to exact
revenge by terrorising and killing people from other nations
oppose and violate the manifest Qurʾānic injunctions and prophetic
traditions.

# 3.7 The Unlawfunless of Usurping the Wealth of Non-Muslims

In Islam, it is unlawful to usurp the wealth of others. God says,

> ‘*And do not eat up one another’s wealth amongst
yourselves through injustice, nor take wealth to the
authorities* [as a bribe] *so that, this way, you may swallow
a portion of others’ wealth unfairly, while you are aware*
[that this is a sin]’.¹

The Prophet ﷺ has also forbidden the pilfering of others’ wealth
and property. He said,

> ‘Indeed, your blood and your property are unlawful to
you’.²

Like the life of non-Muslim citizens, the protection of their
property is also the responsibility of the Muslim state. There is
a consensus amongst the Muslims over this matter. Imam Abū
ʿUbayd al-Qāsim b. Sallām, Ibn Zanjawayh, Ibn Saʿd and Abū
Yūsuf have all cited the provision of the Prophet’s agreement with
the Christians of Najran:

> ‘Indeed, Najran and her allies are under the protection
of God and the guarantee of the Messenger of God ﷺ.
They are to be protected in their wealth, lives, lands and
religion; this includes those who are present and those
who are absent amongst them; and their families, goods
and everything in their possession, be it plentiful or
scarce’.³

The letter ʿUmar wrote to Abū ʿUbayda ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg), the then Governor
of Syria, also contains similar provisions,

> ‘See to it that you prohibit the Muslims [under your
command] from oppressing them [the non-Muslim
citizens], harming them or illegally plundering their
wealth’.⁴

ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said, 

> ‘The non-Muslim citizens pay the tax⁵ so that their blood
and property should be as inviolable as ours’.⁶

So much importance has been associated with the life, property
and honour of the non-Muslim citizens that the Muslim state
has been equally charged with protecting them as it protects the
Muslim citizens. In fact, the Muslims have been prohibited from
destroying the pork and wine belonging to non-Muslim citizens,
and if they do, they must pay a fine. The famous book of Ḥanafī
jurisprudence, *al-Durr al-mukhtār*, states,

> ‘The Muslim who destroys his [the Christian’s] wine and
pork is legally responsible for paying its price’.⁷

Islam has forbidden theft and prescribed strict punishment for
it. When a woman from the Quraysh tribe committed theft during
the time of the Prophet ﷺ, he ordered the prescribed punishment
to be imposed on her. When people requested him to soften the
punishment he ﷺ said,

> ‘By God, had my daughter Fāṭima stolen, I would have
applied the prescribed punishment upon her, too’.⁸

Imam Yaḥyā b. Sharaf al-Nawawī writes,

> ‘In this context, the wealth of the non-Muslim citizen,
the non-Muslim under agreement of protection and the
apostate is certainly like the wealth of a Muslim’.⁹

Imam Ibn Qudāma al-Ḥanbalī mentioned that the prescribed
punishment should be enforced if the possessions of a non-Muslim
are stolen, just as it is imposed when a Muslim’s belongings are
stolen.¹⁰ Ibn Ḥazm mentioned that there is no disagreement that
the prescribed punishment should be applied on the Muslim who
steals the possessions of a non-Muslim citizen.¹¹ Ibn Rushd said
that there is a consensus on this point.¹²

The Muslim and non-Muslim citizens are equal in the eyes of
Islamic law when it comes to the theft of belongings. If a Muslim
steals the belongings of a non-Muslim, the prescribed punishment
will be enforced upon him, and if he unlawfully seizes his wealth,
a discretionary punishment from the ruler [*taʿzīr*] will be carried
out. Islam has given so much importance to the belongings of
non-Muslims that every item of their belongings, which they so
declare, is to be safeguarded, though it may not fall in the category
of belongings in the eyes of the Muslims, such as wine and pork.
If anyone destroys the wine belonging to a Muslim, neither a
prescribed punishment nor a discretionary punishment will be
enforced against him. On the other hand, if a Muslim destroys the
wine and pork belonging to a non-Muslim, he will be required to
pay a fine, because both wine and pork are considered a part of
the non-Muslim’s belongings.

# 3.8 Humiliating Non-Muslim Citizens is Forbidden

Just as the humiliation and violation of a Muslim’s dignity is
forbidden in Islam, it is also forbidden to disgrace and dishonour
a non-Muslim citizen. No Muslim is allowed to abuse a non-
Muslim, or slander or attribute falsehood to him or her. Islam
also restrains its followers from making mention of any flaw in
the person of a non-Muslim, which may be associated with his or
her self, family or lineage.

Once, the son of ʿAmr b. al-ʿĀṣ, the Governor of Egypt, punished
a non-Muslim unjustly. When a complaint of this injustice reached
Caliph ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg), he made the non-Muslim Egyptian publically
exact the same punishment upon the Governor’s son, and uttered
the historic sentence:

> ‘Since when have you regarded people as your slaves,
while their mothers gave birth to them as free men?’¹

Harming a non-Muslim citizen with one’s tongue and hands
and abusing him or her is no less forbidden than doing so to a
Muslim. In *al-Durr al-mukhtār* it is stated:

> ‘All harm must be kept from him [the non-Muslim citizen]
and it is forbidden to backbite him--just as it is for a
Muslim’.²

Imam Shihāb al-Dīn al-Qarāfī, the famous Mālikī jurist, wrote
in his book *al-Furūq* about the rights of non-Muslim citizens:

> The dhimma contract for non-Muslims establishes
certain rights that they have upon us because they live
in proximity to us and are under our protection and care
and the care of God and the Messenger of God a and
the religion of Islam. So whoever transgresses against
them--even if by an evil word or through backbiting--
has neglected the guarantee of God, His Messenger a
and the religion of Islam.³

Ibn ʿĀbidīn al-Shāmī writes about the rights of non-Muslim
citizens:

> That is because due to the contract about non-Muslims,
he [a non-Muslim] deserves the same rights as we do;
and since it is unlawful to backbite a Muslim, it is also
unlawful to backbite him [a non-Muslim]. Nay, they [the
jurists] have said that oppression meted out to a non-Muslim citizen is even severer [in sin].⁴


al-Kāsānī regarded the rights of Muslims and non-Muslims as
equal in his book *Badāʾiʿ al-ṣanāʾiʿ*:

> ‘Non-Muslim citizens enjoy the same rights that are
enjoyed by us (Muslims), and they have the same
responsibilities as we do’.⁵

The aforementioned sayings of the jurists prove that it is the
collective responsibility of all Muslims to protect the honour of
non-Muslim citizens.

The Prophet ﷺ enjoined his followers to treat non-Muslim
citizens with excellence. It is the duty of the Islamic state to
guarantee the protection of the non-Muslim citizens against
oppression, wrongs and excesses. If the Islamic state fails to
deliver justice and security to its non-Muslim citizens, the Prophet ﷺ declared that he would be the advocate of such oppressed
people and that he would restore to them their rights on the Day
of Judgment.

The Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Beware! Whoever wrongs a non-Muslim citizen, or
diminishes any of his rights, or imposes on him more
than he can bear, or takes anything from him without his
consent, I shall plead on his [the latter’s] behalf on the
Day of Resurrection’.⁶

The goal behind the Prophet’s saying was to make the Muslim
society realize its responsibility towards the rights of its non-Muslim citizens, so that they do not falter in discharging this duty.

# 3.9 The Protection of Non-Muslim Citizens from Internal and External Aggression

According to Islamic law, the protection of non-Muslim citizens
is one of the duties of the state. If any person--irrespective of his
association with any nation, religion or state--commits aggression
against a non-Muslim citizen and oppresses him or her, it is the
responsibility of the state to protect that non-Muslim citizen, even
if such protection entails entering into a war. God says,

> ‘*And We seized* [the rest of] *the people who committed
injustice* [actively or passively] *with a very harsh
punishment because they were disobeying*’.¹

The Qurʾān threatens with torment those who oppress others, but
it gives an ever harsher warning to those who allow oppression to
go unchallenged.

Islam has laid great emphasis on the protection of non-Muslim
citizens against internal violence and oppression and has made
their protection the duty of the Islamic state. Islam does not allow
any Muslim citizen to encroach upon the rights of non-Muslim
citizens or resort to oppression and violence against them, verbally
or physically.

There are many Qurʾānic verses and prophetic traditions that
reveal the calamitous repercussions and painful results of atrocities
and oppression, in this world and in the Hereafter. Special
injunctions prohibit oppressing non-Muslim citizens in particular.

A hadith reported in the *Sunan* of Abū Dāwūd has already been
mentioned in which the Prophet ﷺ declared that, on the Day of
Judgment, he will act as an advocate for the oppressed. Another
hadith dealing with the same subject has been reported by ¢Abd
Allāh b. Masʿūd ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) in which the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Whoever hurts a non-Muslim citizen, I shall be his
opponent. And when I am someone’s adversary, I shall
overcome him on the Day of Resurrection’.²

The contemporary nation-states are responsible for taking all
necessary measures to safeguard the lives of their citizens, including
Muslims and non-Muslims, against any external aggression or
war. Since the government is the repository of legal, political and
economic powers coupled with military power, it is obligatory
on the governments to take all required steps for their protection
against any internal danger. ʿAlī ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg), the Leader of the Faithful, said,

> ‘The non-Muslim citizens pay the tax so that their blood
and property should be as inviolable as ours’.³

One of the books of Ḥanbalī jurisprudence, *Maṭālib ūlī al-nuhā*, states,

> ‘It is the duty of the Muslim government to give complete
protection to its non-Muslim citizens against suffering
and torture of every kind, because of their being residents
in the Islamic state’.⁴

If any external power chooses to flex its military muscle against
the non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state and aims to attack
them in any manner, it is incumbent upon the Islamic government
to take urgent measures to protect them. In his book *al-Furūq*,
Imam al-Qarāfī quoted a saying of Ibn Ḥazm from his book *Marātib al-ijmāʿ*,

> ‘It is obligatory for us to go out and wage war against
them [who aggress against the non-Muslim citizens of an
Islamic state] with military might, even though we may
die in the process’.⁵

This is also the viewpoint of Ibn Taymiyya. When the Mongols
occupied Syria, Ibn Taymiyya went to the king for the release
of the prisoners. The Mongol leadership showed their willingness
to release the Muslim prisoners, but refused to release the non-
Muslim citizens. Ibn Taymiyya said, ‘We will not be happy unless
all the prisoners from amongst the Jews and the Christians are
released. They are our non-Muslim citizens and we will not leave
any of our prisoners in captivity, whether they belong to the non-Muslim or Muslim population’. When the king saw the force
of Ibn Taymiyya’s arguments and his unrelenting insistence, he
ordered the release of all Muslim and non-Muslim prisoners.⁶

It is clear in the light of the Qurʾānic verses, prophetic
traditions and sayings of the jurists that no Muslim has the right
to kill a non-Muslim citizen merely on the basis of his being non-Muslim, and it is unlawful to plunder his wealth or dishonour
him. In addition, Islam not only guarantees the protection of the
life, honour and property of non-Muslim citizens, but it also gives
complete protection to their places of worship.
