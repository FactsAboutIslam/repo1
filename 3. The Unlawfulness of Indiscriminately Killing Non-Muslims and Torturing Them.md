# 3. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Non-Muslims and Torturing Them

# 3.1 No Discrimination Between the Killings of Muslim and Non-Muslim Citizens

In the preceding pages, we demonstrated in the light of the Qurʾān
and prophetic traditions that Islam is a religion of peace that
guarantees the protection of life, property and honour for all
members of society, without any discrimination on the basis of
caste, colour, race and religion. In this chapter we will establish
that the protection of the life, honour and property of non-Muslim
citizens living in any Islamic state or any non-Muslim country is
a binding duty upon the Muslims in general and the Islamic state
in particular.

On the occasion of his Last Sermon, the Prophet ﷺ said,
guaranteeing the protection of life, property and honour of the
whole humankind,

> ‘Indeed your blood and your property and your honour
are inviolable, like the inviolability of this day of yours
and this month of yours and this land of yours until the
day you meet your Lord’.¹

Therefore, it is completely forbidden to kill anyone unjustly, or
plunder his wealth, or humiliate him or malign his honour.

Following this principle, killing Muslim and non-Muslim
citizens--wherever they reside--is strictly prohibited on the basis
of equality. It is clearly stated in the Qurʾān,

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.²

This verse uses the word ‘person’ [*nafs*], which is a general
expression that gives the verse a broad-based application. So in
other words unjust killing is completely forbidden, no matter
what religion, language or citizenship is held by the victim. This
is a sin as grave as killing the whole of humanity. Therefore, the
killing of non-Muslim citizens living in an Islamic state falls in the
same category.

# 3.2 The Massacre of Civilian Population and Considering it Lawful is an Act of Disbelief

Killing a person is akin to disbelief. Imam Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī,
one of the Imams of *Ahl al-Sunna* in theology, interpreted the
verse:

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.¹

declaring that murder can be an act of disbelief. He wrote:

> Whoever declares lawful the killing of a person whose
killing has been forbidden by God (except when there is a
valid reason), it is as if he considers it lawful to kill all of
humanity. This is because he disbelieves by his declaring
lawful the killing of one whose killing is unlawful, which
is akin to declaring lawful the killing of humanity entire;
because the one who disbelieves in one verse from God’s
Book disbelieves in the whole of it. . . .

> This verse contains another possible angle of
interpretation, and it is as has been said: His murder of
one person entails the same burden [in the Hereafter] as
if he killed humanity entire. Another possible angle of
interpretation is that it is necessary for everyone to make
a collective effort to help and save the peaceful person
from murder. So, when the murderer kills that harmless
soul or attempts to harm it, it is as if he is attempting to
do that to everyone. . . . This indicates that the verse was
revealed as a ruling for the people of disbelief and the
people of Islam together, if they sow corruption in the
earth.² 

In his *al-Lubāb fī ʿulūm al-Kitāb*, Abū Ḥafṣ al-Ḥanbalī
interpreted the Qurʾānic verse, ‘*it is as if he killed all of humanity*’,³
and declared that the murder of one individual is comparable
to the killing of all of humanity, and he quoted the sayings of
different Imams in support of this position.

> Mujāhid said, ‘If someone kills a soul unjustly, he will go to Hell due to that murder, just as he would have gone to Hell if he killed humanity entire’. Qatāda said, ‘God has made the reward for saving it [a life] tremendous and made the burden of sin [for taking a life unjustly] tremendous, too. This means that whoever declares it lawful for himself to kill a Muslim, it is as if he killed all of humanity’. Interpreting the same verse, Al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, ‘This means that he is liable to legal retribution
[*qiṣāṣ*] for killing it [the sinless soul] as would be the
person who killed all of humanity’.

> God says: ‘*Indeed, those who wage war against God and
His Messenger and remain engaged in creating mischief in
the land* [i.e., perpetrate terrorism, robbery and burglary
amongst people], *their punishment is that they should be
slain, or crucified, or their hands and their feet on opposite
sides should be cut off, or that they should be exiled from
the land. That is for them a humiliation in this world, and
for them there is a terrible torment in the Hereafter--except
those who turn to God in repentance before you overpower
them. So, know that God is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful*’.⁴

> The phrase in the verse, ‘*yuhāribūn Allāh*’ (‘*wage war
against God*’), implies that they wage war against the
friends of God. That is the interpretation maintained by
the overwhelming majority of scholars. Al-Zamakhsharī
said, ‘They wage war against the Messenger of God, and
waging war against the Muslims takes the same ruling as
waging war against him’. This verse was revealed about
the brigands [highway robbers: *quṭṭāʿ al-ṭarīq*] amongst
the Muslims, and [this position is held] by most of the
jurists.⁵

> Indeed, God’s statement, ‘*Those who wage war against
God and His Messenger and remain engaged in creating
mischief in the land*’, includes everyone who possesses
these traits, whether he is a Muslim or a disbeliever.
One cannot object or claim that the verse was revealed
regarding [a group] of disbelievers, because the point of
consideration is the generality of its expression, not the
particular circumstance in which it was revealed.⁶ If it is
said that those who wage war [*muḥāribūn*] are those who
join forces and who possess power and target the Muslims
in their lives and wealth, and that they [the scholars]
agree that if these traits are found amongst people of the
desert wastelands--then they are brigands. And if these
traits are adopted by a group residing in cities, al-Awzāʿī,
Mālik, Layth b. Saʿd and al-Shāfiʿī all agree that they,
too, are considered brigands and that the same prescribed
punishment is to be applied against them. They stated
that when their crimes take place in populated areas the
sin is severer. They inferred this from the aforementioned
verse and the generality of its expression, and because it
is a prescribed punishment, and therefore it is no different
from the other prescribed punishments.⁷

# 3.3 The Killing of Non-Muslim Citizens Makes Paradise Forbidden for the Killer

The non-Muslim citizens of an Islamic state enjoy the same rights
and safeguards as their Muslim counterparts. The first right
endowed upon them by the Islamic state is that of protection against
external aggression and domestic oppression and encroachments,
so they can live their life peacefully, inwardly and outwardly.


Abū Bakra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Any Muslim who unjustly kills a non-Muslim with whom
there is a peace treaty [*muʿāhad*], God will make Paradise
forbidden for him’.¹

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Anyone who kills a non-Muslim under treaty [*muʿāhad*]
will not smell the fragrance of Paradise, even though its
fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years’.²

Therefore, the one who unjustly murders a non-Muslim citizen
will not approach Paradise; rather, he will be kept away from it by
a distance of forty years.
