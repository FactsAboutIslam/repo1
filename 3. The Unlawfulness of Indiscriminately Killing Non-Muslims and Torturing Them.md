# 3. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Non-Muslims and Torturing Them

# 3.1 No Discrimination Between the Killings of Muslim and Non-Muslim Citizens

In the preceding pages, we demonstrated in the light of the Qurʾān
and prophetic traditions that Islam is a religion of peace that
guarantees the protection of life, property and honour for all
members of society, without any discrimination on the basis of
caste, colour, race and religion. In this chapter we will establish
that the protection of the life, honour and property of non-Muslim
citizens living in any Islamic state or any non-Muslim country is
a binding duty upon the Muslims in general and the Islamic state
in particular.

On the occasion of his Last Sermon, the Prophet ﷺ said,
guaranteeing the protection of life, property and honour of the
whole humankind,

> ‘Indeed your blood and your property and your honour
are inviolable, like the inviolability of this day of yours
and this month of yours and this land of yours until the
day you meet your Lord’.¹

Therefore, it is completely forbidden to kill anyone unjustly, or
plunder his wealth, or humiliate him or malign his honour.

Following this principle, killing Muslim and non-Muslim
citizens--wherever they reside--is strictly prohibited on the basis
of equality. It is clearly stated in the Qurʾān,

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.²

This verse uses the word ‘person’ [*nafs*], which is a general
expression that gives the verse a broad-based application. So in
other words unjust killing is completely forbidden, no matter
what religion, language or citizenship is held by the victim. This
is a sin as grave as killing the whole of humanity. Therefore, the
killing of non-Muslim citizens living in an Islamic state falls in the
same category.

# 3.2 The Massacre of Civilian Population and Considering it Lawful is an Act of Disbelief

Killing a person is akin to disbelief. Imam Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī,
one of the Imams of *Ahl al-Sunna* in theology, interpreted the
verse:

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for spreading]
*disorder in the land, it is as if he killed all of humanity*’.¹

declaring that murder can be an act of disbelief. He wrote:

> Whoever declares lawful the killing of a person whose
killing has been forbidden by God (except when there is a
valid reason), it is as if he considers it lawful to kill all of
humanity. This is because he disbelieves by his declaring
lawful the killing of one whose killing is unlawful, which
is akin to declaring lawful the killing of humanity entire;
because the one who disbelieves in one verse from God’s
Book disbelieves in the whole of it. . . .

> This verse contains another possible angle of
interpretation, and it is as has been said: His murder of
one person entails the same burden [in the Hereafter] as
if he killed humanity entire. Another possible angle of
interpretation is that it is necessary for everyone to make
a collective effort to help and save the peaceful person
from murder. So, when the murderer kills that harmless
soul or attempts to harm it, it is as if he is attempting to
do that to everyone. . . . This indicates that the verse was
revealed as a ruling for the people of disbelief and the
people of Islam together, if they sow corruption in the
earth.² 

In his *al-Lubāb fī ʿulūm al-Kitāb*, Abū Ḥafṣ al-Ḥanbalī
interpreted the Qurʾānic verse, ‘*it is as if he killed all of humanity*’,³
and declared that the murder of one individual is comparable
to the killing of all of humanity, and he quoted the sayings of
different Imams in support of this position.

> Mujāhid said, ‘If someone kills a soul unjustly, he will go to Hell due to that murder, just as he would have gone to Hell if he killed humanity entire’. Qatāda said, ‘God has made the reward for saving it [a life] tremendous and made the burden of sin [for taking a life unjustly] tremendous, too. This means that whoever declares it lawful for himself to kill a Muslim, it is as if he killed all of humanity’. Interpreting the same verse, Al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī said, ‘This means that he is liable to legal retribution
[*qiṣāṣ*] for killing it [the sinless soul] as would be the
person who killed all of humanity’.

> God says: ‘*Indeed, those who wage war against God and
His Messenger and remain engaged in creating mischief in
the land* [i.e., perpetrate terrorism, robbery and burglary
amongst people], *their punishment is that they should be
slain, or crucified, or their hands and their feet on opposite
sides should be cut off, or that they should be exiled from
the land. That is for them a humiliation in this world, and
for them there is a terrible torment in the Hereafter--except
those who turn to God in repentance before you overpower
them. So, know that God is Most Forgiving, Ever-Merciful*’.⁴
