# 4. The Unlawfulness of Terrorism against Non-Muslims--Even During Times of War

# 4.1 Preliminary Remarks

According to the Islamic laws on war, it is prohibited to wage
war against neutral countries, even if there are major ideological
disagreements with them. Islam has enjoined upon its followers
to remain peaceful with neutral people, because Islam does not
approve of needless war or senseless conflict. It respects every
human life and ensures that the sanctity and dignity of humanity
is upheld at all times. God says in the Qurʾān,

> ‘*O you who believe! Stand firm for God, witness in
justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you
from being just. Be just; that is closer to righteousness.
And fear God. Indeed, God is Well-Informed of what
you do*’.¹

This verse prohibits the believers from exceeding the limits or
resorting to oppressive measures in their interactions with other
nations, despite the extreme hostility that may be between them.
Imam al-Qurṭubī explained this verse, quoting Abū ʿUbayda and
al-Farrāʾ, ‘This phrase “*lā yajrimannakum* [*do not let . . . prevent
you*]” means that you should not let your hatred of a people cause
you to transgress the truth and engage in falsehood or swerve
from justice to oppression’.²

Similarly, with regard to the prohibition of indiscriminate
massacre, God says,

> ‘*God does not forbid you of those who do not fight
you because of religion and do not expel you from your
homes--from being righteous towards them and treating
them justly. Indeed, God loves the just*’.³ 

The terrorists who indiscriminately murder people through bomb
blasts, suicide bombings and other means of destruction, without
any distinction for religion, race, colour and creed, argue that,
since the foreign powers are doing their utmost to occupy Muslim
lands, and since the Muslims have been subjected to war, they
are fully justified in adopting terrorism as a tactic. This is a false
argument. The divine injunction, ‘*do not let the hatred of a people
prevent you from being just*’, clearly enjoins that no nation or group
of people can be allowed to abandon justice and adopt oppression
as a policy. According to Imam al-Qurṭubī, it is established from
the Qurʾān that Islam orders tolerance, moderation, balance and
harmony under all circumstances--so much so that the massacre
of peaceful people is strictly prohibited even in times of war.

The condemnation of terrorism and the arguments against it
are evident. If we, for a moment, accept the view of the terrorists
and extremists who argue that they are waging a jihad against
anti-Islamic forces, still their activities are outside of the pale of
Islamic laws on war.

# 4.2 The Unlawfulness of Killing Non-Muslim Women

Many people are killed in non-Muslim countries, in addition
to Muslim countries, in the unending wave of terrorism. The
terrorists invoke the anti-Islamic actions of non-Muslim countries
to justify their terrorism, and contend that since these governments
play a role in either killing Muslims or getting them killed
through different means, they are justified in killing their citizens
in retaliation. This argument is contrary to the fundamental
teachings of Islam and contravenes the character of Islam. Islam
does not allow the killing of peaceful non-Muslims in times of
war--much less in times of peace. Islam’s jurisprudential tradition
has articulated what is called in the West, the Just War Theory,
and has detailed regulations that guide the conduct of its soldiers
during war. Thus, the killing of women during war is prohibited.

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘A woman was found slain in one of the expeditions.
Upon this the Messenger of God ﷺ forbade the killing of
women and children’.¹

Ibn Baṭṭāl and Imam al-Nawawī have both supported this
standpoint in *Sharḥ Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī* (5:186) and *Sharḥ Ṣaḥīḥ
Muslim* (12:37), respectively, and declared that killing women is
in direct contravention to Islamic teachings. There is also a hadith
narrated by ʿAbd al-Razzāq in his *Muṣannaf*, al-Shāfiʿī in his *al-Musnad*, al-Ṭaḥāwī in *Sharḥ maʿānī al-āthār* and al-Bayhaqī in *al-Sunan al-kubrā* from the son of Kaʿb b. Mālik ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg)  who mentioned
that when the Prophet ﷺ dispatched an army to Ibn Abī Ḥaqīq,
he forbade the killing of women and children.² Abū Thaʿlaba said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ prohibited the murder of
women and children’.³

# 4.3 The Unlawfulness of Killing the Children of Non-Muslims

The strict and total prohibition prescribed against killing peaceful
non-Muslim children is another humane principle of Islam.
Compare and contrast the actions of the self-proclaimed defenders
of Islam with those of the Prophet ﷺ; the reality will be laid bare for
everyone to see and the intentions of these terrorist elements will
become clear. Would that they had held the prophetic traditions in
due esteem and felt shame while shaping their destructive designs!

Quoting a letter of Ibn ʿAbbās ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg), Imam Muslim wrote in his
collection:

> ‘Indeed, the Messenger of God ﷺ did not kill children; so
you must not kill them either’.¹

In another hadith, the Prophet ﷺ forbade the Companions--
with very harsh words--from killing the children of non-Muslims,
and repeated his prohibition for effect. Aswad b. Sarīʿ ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘We were once in a battle and gained the upper hand
and killed many of the pagans, including some children.
News of this reached the Messenger of God ﷺ and he
said, “What is wrong with some people that they went
so far as to kill children? Beware! Do not kill children at
all! Beware! Do not kill children at all!” Someone asked,
“Why, O Messenger of God? Are they not the children of
the pagans?” He ﷺ replied, “Are the best amongst you
not from the children of pagans?”’²

In another narration it reads: ‘A man said, “O Messenger of
God! They are only the children of the pagans!” He ﷺ replied,

> “The best of you are children of pagans. Beware! Children
must not be killed”.’³

Regarding the prohibition of killing non-Muslim women,
children and elderly folk during war, the respected Ḥanafī jurist,
Imam al-Sarakhsī, wrote in his magnum opus, *al-Mabsūṭ*:

> The Prophet ﷺ said, ‘Do not kill children [*walīd*]’. In
the [Arabic] language, the word *walīd* means one who is
born [*mawlūd*]; and every human being [*ādamī*] is born;
however, customarily this word is only used for young
children. Therefore, in it is proof that it is impermissible to
kill the young children amongst them [the non-Muslims],
as long as they are not fighting. It is mentioned in a
hadith that the Prophet ﷺ forbade the killing of women
and children, and said, ‘Kill the [warring] elders of the
pagans [during the state of war] and keep alive their
subordinates’. What is meant by ‘elders’ are the adults
amongst them, and what is meant by ‘subordinates’ are
their followers amongst the young and the womenfolk.
To ‘keep alive’ here means to take them as captives.
God says, ‘*And they kept their women alive*’.⁴ 1 And it is
mentioned in Abū Bakr’s g dictated commands to Yazīd
b. Abī Sufyān: ‘Kill neither a feeble old man nor a fragile
young child’; in other words, an elderly man and young
child do not fight.⁵

# 4.4 The Unlawfulness of Killing Elderly Non-Muslims

Islam has strictly and unequivocally forbidden the killing of the
elderly during war. This principle is illustrated in many prophetic
traditions.

Imam Abū Dāwūd narrates on the authority of Anas b. Mālik
![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Do not kill any feeble old man, or any infant or young
child or woman’.¹

Imam Ibn Abī Shayba narrates on the authority of al-Ḍaḥḥāk ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) who said,

> ‘The Prophet ﷺ used to forbid the killing of women and
feeble old men’.²

Imam Ibn Abī Shayba also narrates on the authority of Rāshid b.
Saʿd who said,

>
‘The Messenger of God ﷺ forbade the killing of women,
children and the infirm’.³

Imam al-Bayhaqī narrated a hadith from ʿAlī ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg), that when the
Prophet ﷺ would dispatch an army, he would advise them,

>
‘Do not kill a young boy, a woman or an old man. Do
not cause fountains to dry up and do not destroy any
trees, except those which cause hindrance during war.
Mutilate neither a human nor an animal, and do not
break a promise or breach a trust’.⁴

Jubayr b. Nufayl said,

> ‘A man passed by Thawbān ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg), so he [Thawbān] asked
him, “Where do you intend to go?” The man said, “I
want to wage battle in the path of God”. Thawbān then
said to him, “If war booty comes your way, do not steal
from it, and do not kill an old man or a young boy”.
Upon hearing this, the man asked him, “From whom did
you hear this?” Thawbān replied, “From the Messenger
of God ﷺ”.’⁴

# 4.5 The Unlawfulness of Killing the Religious Leaders of Non-Muslims

Islam has forbidden its adherents from killing the religious leaders
of non-Muslims during the course of war and after the battles have
ceased. There is no justification for fighting against non-Muslim
religious leaders and children if they do not engage in war. The
perpetrators are putting to shame the great values of Islam and its
culture of toleration. Imam Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal quoted Ibn ʿAbbās
![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg)  who said that the Prophet ﷺ would issue clear instructions
when dispatching an army to go into battle. He ﷺ would say,

> ‘Break no promise, steal not from the spoils of war and
do not mutilate bodies or slay children or monks’.¹

Imam Ibn Abī Shayba mentions another hadith from Ibn ʿAbbās ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) in which the Prophet ﷺ said as he dispatched an army,

> ‘Do not kill those who tend to the monasteries’.²

Imam Ibn Abī Shayba also quotes Thābit b. Ḥajjāj al-Kilābī, who
reported that Abū Bakr ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) stood up, praised God and said to
people,

> ‘Beware, no [non-combatant] priest tending to his
monastery should be killed’.³

Imam al-Bayhaqī narrates that Saʿīd b. al-Musayyab ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported
that Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) would always say to the Islamic army
as he dispatched it for legitimate warfare,

> ‘Do not drown or burn date-palm trees. Do not kill any
animal. Do not cut down a fruit-bearing tree. Do not
demolish a church. And do not kill any children or old
people or women. Soon you shall you come upon people
who have secluded themselves in cloisters; you must leave
them to engage in that for whose sake they have secluded
themselves’.⁴

Likewise, another tradition reported by Ṣāliḥ b. Kaysān and
narrated by Imam al-Bayhaqī mentions that Abū Bakr al-Ṣiddīq ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg)
said as he was dispatching the Islamic army towards Syria,

> ‘You shall soon come upon people who have secluded
themselves in monasteries; you must leave them to engage
in that for whose sake they have secluded themselves. Do
not kill an old, feeble man or a woman or a child. Do
not damage any populated area. Do not cut down trees
needlessly. Do not kill animals unless it is for a benefit
[to feed others]. Do not burn down date-palm trees or
drown them. Do not commit any treachery. Do not
mutilate (anyone). Do not behave cowardly. And do not
take anything without right when distributing the spoils
of war’.⁵

In the light of these clear injunctions that prohibit killing the
religious leaders of non-Muslims, what interpretation can one give
to the self-styled and the misplaced religious concepts of those
who murder Islamic religious scholars, destroy the mosques of
those who adhere to other schools of thought and burn down
the shrines of the Sufis? Not only do these people consider these
actions justified, but they also invoke religion by claiming to take
guidance from the Qurʾān and the Sunna!

# 4.6 The Unlawfulness of Killing Non-Muslim Traders and Farmers

Islam has given complete protection to farmers, traders and
businessmen, and forbade killing them, because they are associated
with the economy and financial survival of humanity. There are
several prophetic narrations that speak of this. Imam Ibn Abī Shayba and Imam al-Bayhaqī narrated on the
authority of Jābir b. ʿAbd Allāh ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) who said,

> ‘They [the Muslim soldiers] did not kill the merchants
amongst the pagans’.¹

Imam Ibn Abī Shayba also narrated on the authority of Zayd b.
Wahb that ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) sent him a letter in which he said,

> ‘Do not take anything without right when distributing
the spoils of war, and do not commit any treachery or kill
children. And fear God regarding farmers’.²

Imam al-Bayhaqī’s version of this report reads,

> ‘Fear God regarding the farmers and do not kill them’.³

Ibn al-Qayyim said,

> ‘Indeed, when the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ opened (*fataḥū*) the various lands, they did not kill them [farmers and merchants] because the latter did not fight
[against them], and so in that sense they [the civilians]
resembled the elderly and the religious leaders’.⁴

Imam al-Awzāʿī took a similar view and said,

> ‘Farmers are not to be killed [during war] if it is known
that they are not from the combatants’.⁵

And Ibn Qudāma al-Maqdisī stated,

> ‘As for the farmer who is a non-combatant, he should
not be killed, because it was narrated from ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) that he said, “Fear God regarding the farmers
who do not wage war against you”.’⁶

# 4.7 The Unlawfulness of Killing Non-Muslim Service Personnel

Islamic laws are to regulate the conduct of the Muslim soldiers
during the course of war and restrain them from killing non-Muslim professionals and those tasked with the delivery of
services. Rabāḥ b. Rabīḥ ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘We were with the Messenger of God ﷺ in one of the
battle expeditions, when he saw some people gathered
around something. He sent a man out, saying, “Go and
see what they are gathering around”. The man returned
and informed him, saying, “They are gathering around
a slain woman”. The Prophet ﷺ said, “She was not
amongst those who fight!” At the head of the group was
Khālid b. Walīd, so the Prophet sent a man to go and
inform Khālid: “Neither an [idolatrous] woman nor a
hired servant should be killed”.’ [In one report:] ‘Do not
kill children or hired servants’.¹

In fact, non-Muslim employees working in the households of
non-Muslim employers in the conquered areas are not to be killed
and no kind of tax can be imposed upon them. Ibn al-Qayyim
stated the same thing, quoting ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg):

> ‘The blood of a servant is inviolable, and is thereby
similar to that of women and children’.²

Likewise, Ibn al-Mundhir cited a consensus amongst the
scholars that, like the unemployed, the old, the sick, the destitute
and women and children of non-Muslims--no tax can be levelled
on the servants under their responsibility and care.³

# 4.8 The Unlawfulness of Killing Non-Muslims Who are Non-Combatants

Islam holds that the sanctity of life is superior to the sanctity of the
Kaʿba. That is why shedding blood unjustly has been condemned
in the harshest possible terms. The only enemies who are allowed
to be killed are those who actively take part in combat. A large
part of population, which is non-combatant, including children,
women, the old, the sick and the disabled, have been excluded
from this. On the day of the conquest of Mecca, the Prophet ﷺ
ordered that those who were not fighting should run away to save
their lives, and shut their doors, and he ordered that those who
were injured should not be attacked.

Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg)
that the Messenger of God ﷺ said on the day of the conquest of
Mecca,

> ‘Whoever enters Abū Sufyān’s house is safe, and whoever
lays down his weapon is safe and whoever shuts his door
is safe’.¹

All of these steps convey the message of peace and protection.

It is reported in ʿAbd al-Razzāq’s *Muṣannaf* that ʿAlī b. Abī
Ṭālib ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘The injured person or prisoner should not be killed, and
the one who flees should not be pursued’.²

According to another narration recorded by ʿAbd al-Razzāq,
Juwaybir reported that a woman from the tribe of Banū Asad told
him that she heard ʿAmmār ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) declare after ʿAlī ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) had finished
the Battle of the Camel,

> ‘Do not kill an injured person and do not enter the
house of someone who has laid down his arms, for he is
considered safe. Similarly, the one who shuts his door is
considered safe’.³

# 4.9 The Unlawfulness of Waging Night Offensives against Non-Muslims

The military code of conduct enshrined in the Shariah holds that
enemies should not be attacked at night. Military forces should
wait until dawn when launching their offensives so that non-combatants, such as women, children, the old and the sick, do not
become frightened and have their sleep disturbed.

Imam al-Bukhārī and Imam Muslim narrated on the authority
of Anas b. Mālik ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) who said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ came to Khaybar at night, and when he came to a people [a force] at night, he would not attack them until daybreak’.¹

Contrast the prophetic laws concerning war with the methods
of the modern-day terrorists who bomb populated areas without
any care for peaceful life.

# 4.10 The Unlawfulness of Burning Non-Muslims 

In the pre-Islamic days of ignorance, a man would go to such
extremes in revenge and enmity against his opponents during war
that he would burn them alive. The Prophet ﷺ forbade Muslims
from resorting to this barbaric tactic.

ʿAbd al-Raḥmān b. ʿAbd Allāh quoted his father as saying that
once they were on a journey and the Prophet ﷺ went to relieve
himself. After he left, the Companions saw a sparrow with two of
her young hatchlings. When they took the hatchlings, the sparrow,
greatly upset, came and began to spread out her wings. When the
Prophet ﷺ returned he said,

> ‘Who has tormented this bird by taking her young ones?
Give them back to her’.¹

In another report the Prophet ﷺ saw an anthill that was burned
and declared,

> ‘It is not fitting that anyone but the Lord of the fire should
punish with the fire’.²

If Islam has forbidden the burning of ants, how can it allow
the burning of human beings? Likewise, when the Prophet ﷺ sent
his Companions for war, he ordered them to avoid burning their
enemies.³ But in the wake of the recent bomb blasts and suicide
attacks that burn the harmless people and tear them to pieces, the
so-called Muslim terrorist groups that accept responsibility for
these attacks convey to the world that the Muslims’ concept of
jihad is barbaric and oppressive. The opposite, however, is true
and Islam has nothing to do with any of this.

# 4.13 Summary

In the light of the aforementioned explanations, it is evident that
even when war is imposed on Islam, and the Muslims are made
victims of external aggression and the Islamic state is compelled
to order its armies to fight in defence, children, women and the
elderly cannot be killed. Furthermore, damaging crops, destroying
buildings, properties and places of worship are also strictly
forbidden. How can Islam, which does not allow these practices
during jihad, condone and approve the killing of non-combatants
who are not directly involved in the aggression and who are
going about their daily routines? It is abundantly clear that such
activities are in direct contravention of the teachings of the Qurʾān
and hadith.
