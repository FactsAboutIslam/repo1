# 2. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Muslims

# 2.1 The Sanctity of a Believer is Greater Than the Kaʿba

There are some people who declare that the majority of the
Muslims are disbelievers, polytheists and innovators on account
of political, ideological or religious differences, and subsequently
massacre them ruthlessly. They must know the sanctity and honour
of a believer’s life in the sight of God and His Messenger ﷺ. The
Prophet ﷺ declared the honour and dignity of a believer greater
than that of the Kaʿba, the Sacred House of God. Imam Ibn Mājah
transmitted a hadith on this subject.

> ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said, ‘Once, I saw the Messenger
of God ﷺ circumambulating the Kaʿba and he was
addressing it: “How excellent you are and how sweet
your smell is! How grand you are and how grand your
sacredness is! By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s
soul, the inviolability of a believer’s property and blood
is greater in the sight of God than your sacredness. We
must think only well of a believer”.’¹

# 2.2 Merely Pointing a Weapon at a Believer is Prohibited

Killing people with explosives or other weapons is a grave sin,
but even pointing a weapon towards a believer is forbidden, and
the one who does it is cursed. Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘None of you should point a weapon at his brother, for
he does not know, for perhaps the devil may draw it out
while it is in his hand, resulting in his falling into a pit
of Hell’.¹

Here, metaphorical language has been employed. Someone who
wields a weapon might fire it at the spur of the moment and hit
someone. This act has been linked to Satan so that people regard
it as a satanic act and stay away from it. This has been elaborated
in another hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Whoever points a piece of iron [e.g., a gun] at his brother,
the angels will curse him until he puts it down, even if he
[the one at whom it is pointed] is his brother of the same
father and mother’.²

The Prophet ﷺ not only forbade pointing a weapon at someone,
but he also forbade displaying it. Jābir ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ forbade that an unsheathed (*maslūl*)
sword be handed to someone else’.³

While a drawn swordor any other weapon for that matter
may cause injury, displaying it might provoke one to violence.
What can be a greater proof of Islam’s status as a religion of
peace, security and advancement, for the word ‘*maslūl*’ used
in the aforementioned hadith essentially indicates that defence
institutions charged with keeping arms must also adopt foolproof
security measures to ensure that their weapons will not be misused!

If displaying weapons and pointing them at others are strictly
prohibitedas proven in the above mentioned hadiththen how
grave a sin and atrocity it is to challenge the authority of a Muslim
state and destroy the lives and properties of civilians through
bomb blasts and suicide attacks!

# 2.3 The Unlawfulness of Violence against Muslims 

Islam not only outlaws the mass killing of Muslims but the whole of
humanity, without any discrimination on the basis of caste, colour,
race or religion. One can appreciate the value and inviolability of
human life in Islam by realising that the act of killing a human
being has been equated with slaughtering the entire human race.
In connection with human dignity, God says in the Qurʾān, 

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for bloodshed,
robbery and spreading] *disorder in the land, it is as if he
killed all of humanity*’.¹

This verse highlights the sanctity of human life in general. The
sanctity of a man or woman, the old or the young, the rich or the
poor has not been specified. The point being that the Qurʾān has
not only prohibited killing a man without any justification, but
has also declared that it is akin to the murder of humanity entire.
As for the law of retribution, which authorizes capital punishment
for a murderer, it has been legislated for safeguarding the sanctity
of human life.
