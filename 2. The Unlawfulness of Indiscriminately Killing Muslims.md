# 2. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Muslims

# 2.1 The Sanctity of a Believer is Greater Than the Kaʿba

There are some people who declare that the majority of the
Muslims are disbelievers, polytheists and innovators on account
of political, ideological or religious differences, and subsequently
massacre them ruthlessly. They must know the sanctity and honour
of a believer’s life in the sight of God and His Messenger ﷺ. The
Prophet ﷺ declared the honour and dignity of a believer greater
than that of the Kaʿba, the Sacred House of God. Imam Ibn Mājah
transmitted a hadith on this subject.

> ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said, ‘Once, I saw the Messenger
of God ﷺ circumambulating the Kaʿba and he was
addressing it: “How excellent you are and how sweet
your smell is! How grand you are and how grand your
sacredness is! By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s
soul, the inviolability of a believer’s property and blood
is greater in the sight of God than your sacredness. We
must think only well of a believer”.’¹

# 2.2 Merely Pointing a Weapon at a Believer is Prohibited

Killing people with explosives or other weapons is a grave sin,
but even pointing a weapon towards a believer is forbidden, and
the one who does it is cursed. Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘None of you should point a weapon at his brother, for
he does not know, for perhaps the devil may draw it out
while it is in his hand, resulting in his falling into a pit
of Hell’.¹

Here, metaphorical language has been employed. Someone who
wields a weapon might fire it at the spur of the moment and hit
someone. This act has been linked to Satan so that people regard
it as a satanic act and stay away from it. This has been elaborated
in another hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Whoever points a piece of iron [e.g., a gun] at his brother,
the angels will curse him until he puts it down, even if he
[the one at whom it is pointed] is his brother of the same
father and mother’.²

The Prophet ﷺ not only forbade pointing a weapon at someone,
but he also forbade displaying it. Jābir ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ forbade that an unsheathed (*maslūl*)
sword be handed to someone else’.³

While a drawn swordor any other weapon for that matter
may cause injury, displaying it might provoke one to violence.
What can be a greater proof of Islam’s status as a religion of
peace, security and advancement, for the word ‘*maslūl*’ used
in the aforementioned hadith essentially indicates that defence
institutions charged with keeping arms must also adopt foolproof
security measures to ensure that their weapons will not be misused!

If displaying weapons and pointing them at others are strictly
prohibitedas proven in the above mentioned hadiththen how
grave a sin and atrocity it is to challenge the authority of a Muslim
state and destroy the lives and properties of civilians through
bomb blasts and suicide attacks!

# 2.3 The Unlawfulness of Violence against Muslims 

Islam not only outlaws the mass killing of Muslims but the whole of
humanity, without any discrimination on the basis of caste, colour,
race or religion. One can appreciate the value and inviolability of
human life in Islam by realising that the act of killing a human
being has been equated with slaughtering the entire human race.
In connection with human dignity, God says in the Qurʾān, 

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for bloodshed,
robbery and spreading] *disorder in the land, it is as if he
killed all of humanity*’.¹

This verse highlights the sanctity of human life in general. The
sanctity of a man or woman, the old or the young, the rich or the
poor has not been specified. The point being that the Qurʾān has
not only prohibited killing a man without any justification, but
has also declared that it is akin to the murder of humanity entire.
As for the law of retribution, which authorizes capital punishment
for a murderer, it has been legislated for safeguarding the sanctity
of human life.

# 2.4 The Unlawfulness of Killing Someone Who Accepts Islam in the midst of Fighting

Although the common notion expressed around the world is that
all is fair in love and war, Islam does not agree. It has laid down
rules and regulations for the battlefield, and the life and blessed
practice of the Prophet of Islam ﷺ enjoin us to observe caution,
care and fair play, even in the most critical and troubled moments
of war. The Prophet ﷺ showed his strong displeasure over the
killing of a man who declared his acceptance of the faith (which
*was* perhaps under the fear of death) when he was under the sword
and about to be slain. If that was his displeasure over someone
killed in a state of battle, what about killing Muslims and people
of knowledge only because their views differ with the extremist
ideologies of the rebel terrorist groups?

Usāma b. Zayd b. Ḥāritha ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ dispatched us to fight against
Ḥuraqa, a branch of the Juhayna tribe, so we reached
the tribesmen in the morning and defeated them. One of
the *Anṣār* and I jointly caught up to a man of that tribe.
When we overpowered him, he said, “There is no god
but God”. Upon hearing this, the *Anṣārī* held back from
him, but I stabbed him with my spear until I killed him.
When we came back, the news had already reached the
Prophet ﷺ so he said to me, “O Usāma, did you kill him
after he said, ‘There is no god but God’?” I said, “O
Messenger of God, he was merely seeking refuge. (He
uttered the formula to save his life)!” He said again, “Did
you kill him after he said, ‘There is no god but God’?” He
kept repeating that to me, until I wished that I had not
embraced Islam before that day!’¹

The version of Imam Muslim reads:

> ‘So he ﷺ summoned him and asked him, “Why did you
kill him?” He said, “O Messenger of God, he caused pain
to the Muslims, and he killed so-and-so and so-and-so,
and I attacked him, so when he saw the sword, he said,
‘There is no god but God’!” The Messenger of God ﷺ
asked him, “Did you kill him?” When he said, “Yes”,
he said, “So how will you deal with ‘There is no god
but God’ when the Day of Resurrection comes?” He said,
“O Messenger of God, seek forgiveness on my behalf!”
He said again: “So how will you deal with ‘There is no
god but God’ when the Day of Resurrection comes?” He
then kept saying, without adding anything: “How will
you deal with ‘There is no god but God’ when the Day of
Resurrection comes?”’²

Miqdād b. Aswad ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘I said to the Messenger of God, “What do you think,
if I meet a man of the disbelievers and we fight and he
strikes one of my hands with his sword and cuts it off and
then takes refuge from me behind a tree and says, ‘I have
surrendered to God’? Should I kill him, O Messenger of
God, after he has said that?” The Messenger of God ﷺ
said, “No. Do not kill him. If you were to kill him, then he
would be in your position [i.e., Muslim] before you killed
him and you would be in his position [i.e., disbeliever]
before he said that word which he said”.’³

In the light of these merciful and benevolent teachings of the
Prophet ﷺ, the brutal and ruthless terrorists, who indiscriminately
massacre peaceful Muslims, must ponder over and abandon their
misanthropist and barbaric ideologies and dreadful beliefs. If the
life of an enemy in the battlefield is protected when he accepts
faith, then how odious it is to massacre Muslims in mosques, and
how egregious it is to slay them in offices, educational institutes,
markets and public buildings!

# 2.5 Becoming an Accomplice to Terrorists is also a Crime

The Prophet ﷺ categorically forbade people to provide help or
material support to terrorists. He ordered us to isolate them and
deny them any numerical strength, financial assistance and moral
support. Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘If anyone helps in the murder of a believereven if with
only a few wordshe will meet God with the words
written on his forehead: “hopeless of God’s mercy”.’¹

This hadith also indicates that it is not only financial and
numerical assistance that must be denied to terrorists, but,
according to the expression ‘*bi shaṭri kalimatin*’ (‘a few words’),
speeches or writings which lend support to the enemies of peace
are also condemnable and must be banned. Such support can only
deprive us of God’s forgiveness and mercy. This hadith contains
a strict warning to those who mastermind terrorist acts and
misinterpret the Qurʾān by brainwashing youth with glad tidings
of Paradise for murdering peaceful civilians.

# 2.6 Those Who Attack Mosques Are the Greatest Wrongdoers

Islam not only teaches its adherents to maintain peace and observe
tolerance with other communities, but it also instils in them a
respect for the beliefs and viewpoints, and norms and rituals of
those who do not share their faith and creed. To launch attacks
against opponents, their properties and sacred sites on account of
religious, ideological or political differences is not only against
the express spirit of Islam but is inhumane as well. Those who
violate the sanctity of the houses of God and kill peaceful and
devout worshippers through bomb explosions and suicide attacks
are neither true believers nor people of guidance. Those who
hinder people from making mention of God’s name in mosques,
by spreading terror and intimidation, through violence and
terrorism are grave sinners and enemies of peace; the Qurʾān, in
fact, declares them the greatest wrongdoers and warns them of an
immense suffering in the Hereafter. God says,

> ‘*And who is more unjust than he who forbids the
remembrance of God’s name in the places of prostration*
[mosques] *and strives to demolish them? It was not
proper for them to enter the mosques but in a state of
fear* [fearing God]. *For them is disgrace in this world and
there is a dreadful torment for them in the Hereafter*’.¹

Elsewhere, God proclaims that those who maintain the houses
of worship are only those who believe in God and the Last Day;
it is they who are the guided ones. This implies that those people,
who, instead of maintaining the houses of worship, mount attacks
on them, believe neither in Islam nor in the Day of Judgement.
God says,

> ‘*Only he who believes in God and the Last Day and
establishes prayer and pays Zakat and who fears none but
God can maintain and frequent the mosques of God. So
they alone are expected to be amongst the rightly guided*’.²

Consider the life and company of the miscreants who violate
the sanctity of mosques and tombs of Muslim saints! With a
little thought, one will quickly discover that their ideological and
intellectual growth takes place in an atmosphere laden with narrow-
mindedness. This narrow-mindedness generates extremism, which
further leads to violence and aggression. And aggression takes its
logical shapethat being the monstrosity known as terrorism
which is the outcome of hatred, prejudice and violence, which
strip us of the qualities of love, peace, moderation and tolerance.
Such a person, in the words of the Qurʾān, becomes stone-hearted:

> ‘*Then* [even] *after this your hearts hardened. So* [in
hardness] *they* [have become] *like stones, or even harder*’.³

Such a person is the worst embodiment of wretchedness and
callous nihilism; he descends to a low level and takes the lives of
peaceful people in shops, markets, public places and educational
institutions. He sets himself loose on people engaged in worship
at mosques, and does not hesitate to tear down places of worship.
What do these terroristic acts have to do with Islam? Had there
been just a little fear of God and the Afterlife within such people,
at least the mosques would have been safe, and the Muslims busy
worshipping God would have been in peace. This mindset proves
that terrorists have no link with Islam, which is the religion of
peace, harmony, safety and tolerance.

# 2.7 Killing a Muslim is a Greater Sin than Destroying the World

How can wrongdoers who brutally kill peaceful citizens to realize
their vicious objectives claim to be the stalwarts of peace and
security? They are engaged in the wanton killing of thousands
of non-combatant Muslims through their terrorist activities;
however, the Prophet ﷺ declared that killing a Muslim is a greater
sin than destroying the whole world.

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAmr ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ
said,

> ‘Certainly, the passing away of the entire world is less in
the sight of God than the murder of a single Muslim’.¹

ʿAbd Allāh b. Burayda ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported from his father that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘Killing a believer is a more serious matter in the sight of
God than the destruction of the entire world’.²

Another report says the killing of a man, without legal
authority, is a tragedy more serious than the passing away of the
entire world. Al-Barāʾ b. ʿĀzib ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Messenger of
God ﷺ said,

> ‘Certainly, in the estimation of God, the passing away
of the whole world is lighter than unjustly shedding the
blood of a human being’.³ 

The humiliating punishment of a murderer who intentionally
kills a believer can be understood from the verse wherein God
mentioned the punishment of Hell for these sinners with phrases
such as ‘*abide for ages*’, ‘*His wrath*’, ‘*curse him*’ and ‘*dreadful
torment*’. God says,

> ‘But he who kills a Muslim deliberately, his recompense
will be Hell, wherein will he abide for ages. God will
afflict him with His wrath and will curse him. And He
has prepared for him a dreadful torment’.⁴

# 2.8 The Massacre of Muslims is an Act of Disbelief

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ declared that shedding the blood of
peaceful Muslims and spreading violence and mischief in society
are disbelief and cause one to revert from Islam to disbelief,
technically known as apostasy, or *irtidād*. Imam al-Bukhārī
narrates on the authority of ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAbbās ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘Do not revert as disbelievers after me by striking one
another’s necks!’¹

Therefore, committing murder and killing Muslims is a clear act
of disbelief, which bears a likeness to apostasy.

Me, Striking One Another’s Necks!”’, 6:2594 §6668; and al-Ṭabarānī in *al-Muʿjam al-awsaṭ*, 4:269 §4166.

# 2.9 Like Polytheism, Murder is One of the Greatest Wrongs

Ibn Kathīr interpreted the verse,

> ‘*But he who kills a Muslim deliberately*’,¹

declaring intentional murder a major sin that it is so severe and
grave, that God has mentioned it in conjunction with the greatest
wrongthat of *shirk*, or idolatry. He writes:

> This is a stern warning and emphatic Divine threat to
those who perpetrate this grievous sin that is connectedin more than one verse in God’s Bookwith the taking
of partners in worship along with God. The Most High
says in *Sūra al-Furqān*, ‘*And* [the believers are] *those
who do not worship any other god besides God, or kill
a soul unlawfullyexcept with just causeor commit
adultery*’.² And God says, ‘*Say* [O Prophet], “*Come, I will
recite to you those things which your Lord has forbidden
to you: Do not set up anything as a partner with Him;
treat your parents with excellence and do not kill your
children owing to poverty. We alone give you sustenance
and* [will provide for] *them as well. And do not draw near
to shameful deeds, be they open or hidden. And do not
kill the soul whose* [killing] *God has forbidden, except
when it is justified* [legally]. *These are the injunctions He
has enjoined upon you so that you may apply reason*”.’
[Qurʾān 6:151]³

As he was delivering his Last Sermon on the eve of the Hajj, the
Prophet ﷺ made clear the unlawfulness of killing and pointed out
its inherent evil. He said,

> ‘Indeed your blood and your property are inviolable,
like the inviolability of this day of yours and this month
of yours and this land of yours, until the day you meet
your Lord. Listen, have I conveyed the message?’ The
Companions replied, ‘Yes’. He ﷺ said, ‘O God! Bear
witness. Let the one present inform those who are absent,
for perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed will retain it
better than he who hears it [directly]. Do not revert as
disbelievers after me, striking each other’s necks’.⁴

The Messenger of God ﷺ has clearly given the judgement in
this agreed upon hadith that those who shed blood, engage in
violence and acts of terrorism, raise arms and kill Muslims are no
longer Muslims; they are disbelievers. The Messenger of God ﷺ
has removed all doubts about this, using the words, ‘Do not revert 
as disbelievers after me, striking each other’s necks’. This is a clear
declaration that those who commit terrorism and mass murder are
disbelievers.

Abū Saʿīd al-Khudrī and Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the
Prophet ﷺ said regarding the murder of a believer,

> ‘Even if all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth
gathered together to shed the blood of a single believer,
God would cast them all in the Hellfire’.⁵

# 2.10 Bloodshed is the Greatest of all Crimes

Mass murder, bloodshed, and unjust killing are such grave offences
that God Most High will take those who commit them to task
before anything else on the Day of Resurrection. ʿAbd Allāh b.
Masʿūd ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said while describing the enormity of shedding blood unlawfully,

> ‘The first issue that will be judged between people on the
Day of Resurrection is that of blood [i.e., murder]’.¹

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ warned about
the disastrous consequences of fighting and bloodshed and said,

> ‘Of the serious matters from which no one who brings it upon himself and falls into it will escape is that of blood
that was shed unlawfully’.²

Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘Time will seem to get shorter and knowledge will
diminish. Miserliness will surface and tribulations will
rise and *haraj* will abound’. The Companions asked, ‘O
Messenger of God, what is *haraj*?’ He said, ‘It is killing.
It is killing’.³

When peaceful civilians are targets of terrorism, tyranny and
barbarism, and are victimized due to doctrinal and ideological
differences between the political and religious personalities, the
logical consequence is anarchy, chaos, lawlessness and strife. ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘We were once sitting with the Prophet a when he
described the tribulations. He described them at length,
until he mentioned the tribulation of *al-aḥlās*. At that
point, someone asked, “O Messenger of God! What is
the tribulation of *al-aḥlās*?” The Prophet ﷺ said, “It is
chaos and mass killing”.’⁴

# 2.11 Those Who Subject Muslims to Burning through Explosions and Other Means Belong in the Hellfire

According to the Qurʾān, terrorists who bomb common people,
engage in suicide bombings and otherwise kill peaceful people are
criminals who are destined to suffer the torments of the Hellfire.
The chapter of the Qurʾān, *al-Burūj*, prohibits the burning of
common people:

> ‘*Indeed, those who subject the believing men and women
to tribulation* [*fatanū*] *and then do not repent, for them
is the punishment of Hell, and for them is a burning
torment*’.¹

Some Qurʾān exegetes interpret the word *fatanū* as ‘burning
in fire’. This verse implies that those who burn people through
bomb blasts are the inhabitants of the Hellfire. Ibn ʿAbbās and
Muqātil said, ‘The words ‘*fatanū al-muʾminīna*’ (subject the
believers to tribulation) mean: “They burnt them (the believers)
with fire”.’² ʿAbd b. Ḥumayd and Ibn al-Mundhir reported that
Qatāda said regarding the verse, ‘*Indeed those who subject the
believing men and women to tribulation*’, ‘This means killing by
burning’.³ Imam al-Qurṭubī and Abū Ḥafṣ
al-Ḥanbalī have also given the same interpretation.⁴

Those who deem it lawful to kill the Muslims are out of the
fold of Islam, and are liable to the torment of the blazing fire of
Hell. ʿAbd Allāh b. Busr ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘The envious, the calumnious and the soothsayer are not
from me, and I am not from them’. Then the Messenger
of God ﷺ recited the following verse: ‘*And those who
hurt the believing men and women without their doing
anything* [wrong], *surely they bear the burden of slander
and clear sin*’. [Qurʾān 33:58]⁵

In Imam Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī’s exegesis of the Qurʾān, it is written:

> ‘Both punishments will occur in the Hereafter; however,
the torment of the Hellfire will be on account of their
disbelief, and the burning torment will be an additional
punishment meted out to them on account of their
burning of the believers’.⁶

The authors of the Qurʾānic exegesis, *Tafsīr al-Jalālayn*, also held
the same view:

> ‘“*Indeed, those who subject the believing men and
women to tribulation* [*fatanū*]” by burning, “*and then
do not repent, for them is the punishment of Hell*” due
to their disbelief, “*and for them is a burning torment*”,
in other words, the punishment in the Hereafter for them
having burnt the believers’.⁷

# 2.12 No Act of Worship Performed by a Murderer of a Muslim is Acceptable

No act of worship, whether obligatory or supererogatory,
performed by the one who kills the Muslims will be accepted.
ʿAbd Allāh b. al-Ṣāmit ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ
said,

> ‘God will not accept any act of worship, obligatory or
supererogatory, from the one who attacks a Muslim and
kills him’.¹

Those who perform acts of worship and acts of vigorous
religious discipline, but who also commit violence and murders,
are unfortunate creatures whose worship will be rejected. Inflicting
humiliation upon humans and expecting deliverance by means of
pious acts of worship will only earn them the torment of Hell:

> ‘*For them is the punishment of Hell, and for them is a
burning torment*’.²

# 2.13 Those Who Torture Muslims Will Face the Torment of Hell

Persecuting members of the Muslim community by subjecting them to violence, tyranny and brutality is strictly forbidden. God
has threatened those who do such deeds with a painful torment:


> ‘*Indeed, those who subject the believing men and women
to tribulation* [*fatanū*] *and then do not repent, for them
is the punishment of Hell, and for them is a burning
torment*’.¹

Those who oppress God’s creation will face the consequences
of their vicious deeds. Hishām b. al-Ḥakīm ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘Indeed, God shall inflict His torment upon those who
torture people in the life of this world’.² 

All of the Imams of Qurʾānic exegesis concurred that Hell
shall be the abode of those who oppress and torture Muslims.
Interpreting this Qurʾānic verse, Imam Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī
posited that this applies to ‘everyone who does thatand this is
more fitting, because both the wording and the ruling are general,
and so a specification would entail leaving the apparent meaning
without proof’.³ So, it is just as fitting to apply the ruling in these
verses to the so-called ‘religious’ terrorists of today.⁴

# 2.14 The Unlawfulness of Suicide

Suicide is forbidden in Islam. The one who commits suicide defies
God and becomes a resident of Hell. Before examining the revealed
texts that forbid suicide, let us consider why it is forbidden.

Human life is neither owned nor acquired; it is a gift and
trust from God. The blessing of life serves as a basis for all
other blessings. It is for this reason that Islam directs people to
safeguard their lives and forbids suicide. Islam does not allow any
human being to take his or her own life. On the contrary, the
teachings of Islam emphasize the safety and security of life and
body. These teachings aim at preserving human life and ensuring
the continuation of humanity.

# 2.15 The Qurʾānic Texts and Hadith Reports on Suicide

As mentioned earlier, the real owner of life and death is God. So
just as murdering a person is akin to murdering all of humanity,
so too is suicide considered a despicable act. God says,
