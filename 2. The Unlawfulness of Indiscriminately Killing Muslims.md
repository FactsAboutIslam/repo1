# 2. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Muslims

# 2.1 The Sanctity of a Believer is Greater Than the Kaʿba

There are some people who declare that the majority of the
Muslims are disbelievers, polytheists and innovators on account
of political, ideological or religious differences, and subsequently
massacre them ruthlessly. They must know the sanctity and honour
of a believer’s life in the sight of God and His Messenger ﷺ. The
Prophet ﷺ declared the honour and dignity of a believer greater
than that of the Kaʿba, the Sacred House of God. Imam Ibn Mājah
transmitted a hadith on this subject.

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said, ‘Once, I saw the Messenger
of God ﷺ circumambulating the Kaʿba and he was
addressing it: “How excellent you are and how sweet
your smell is! How grand you are and how grand your
sacredness is! By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s
soul, the inviolability of a believer’s property and blood
is greater in the sight of God than your sacredness. We
must think only well of a believer”.’¹
