# 2. The Unlawfulness of Indiscriminately Killing Muslims

# 2.1 The Sanctity of a Believer is Greater Than the Kaʿba

There are some people who declare that the majority of the
Muslims are disbelievers, polytheists and innovators on account
of political, ideological or religious differences, and subsequently
massacre them ruthlessly. They must know the sanctity and honour
of a believer’s life in the sight of God and His Messenger ﷺ. The
Prophet ﷺ declared the honour and dignity of a believer greater
than that of the Kaʿba, the Sacred House of God. Imam Ibn Mājah
transmitted a hadith on this subject.

> ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿUmar ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said, ‘Once, I saw the Messenger
of God ﷺ circumambulating the Kaʿba and he was
addressing it: “How excellent you are and how sweet
your smell is! How grand you are and how grand your
sacredness is! By the One in Whose Hand is Muhammad’s
soul, the inviolability of a believer’s property and blood
is greater in the sight of God than your sacredness. We
must think only well of a believer”.’¹

# 2.2 Merely Pointing a Weapon at a Believer is Prohibited

Killing people with explosives or other weapons is a grave sin,
but even pointing a weapon towards a believer is forbidden, and
the one who does it is cursed. Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘None of you should point a weapon at his brother, for
he does not know, for perhaps the devil may draw it out
while it is in his hand, resulting in his falling into a pit
of Hell’.¹

Here, metaphorical language has been employed. Someone who
wields a weapon might fire it at the spur of the moment and hit
someone. This act has been linked to Satan so that people regard
it as a satanic act and stay away from it. This has been elaborated
in another hadith in which the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘Whoever points a piece of iron [e.g., a gun] at his brother,
the angels will curse him until he puts it down, even if he
[the one at whom it is pointed] is his brother of the same
father and mother’.²

The Prophet ﷺ not only forbade pointing a weapon at someone,
but he also forbade displaying it. Jābir ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ forbade that an unsheathed (*maslūl*)
sword be handed to someone else’.³

While a drawn swordor any other weapon for that matter
may cause injury, displaying it might provoke one to violence.
What can be a greater proof of Islam’s status as a religion of
peace, security and advancement, for the word ‘*maslūl*’ used
in the aforementioned hadith essentially indicates that defence
institutions charged with keeping arms must also adopt foolproof
security measures to ensure that their weapons will not be misused!

If displaying weapons and pointing them at others are strictly
prohibitedas proven in the above mentioned hadiththen how
grave a sin and atrocity it is to challenge the authority of a Muslim
state and destroy the lives and properties of civilians through
bomb blasts and suicide attacks!

# 2.3 The Unlawfulness of Violence against Muslims 

Islam not only outlaws the mass killing of Muslims but the whole of
humanity, without any discrimination on the basis of caste, colour,
race or religion. One can appreciate the value and inviolability of
human life in Islam by realising that the act of killing a human
being has been equated with slaughtering the entire human race.
In connection with human dignity, God says in the Qurʾān, 

> ‘*Whoever kills a person* [unjustly], *except as a punishment
for murder or* [as a prescribed punishment for bloodshed,
robbery and spreading] *disorder in the land, it is as if he
killed all of humanity*’.¹

This verse highlights the sanctity of human life in general. The
sanctity of a man or woman, the old or the young, the rich or the
poor has not been specified. The point being that the Qurʾān has
not only prohibited killing a man without any justification, but
has also declared that it is akin to the murder of humanity entire.
As for the law of retribution, which authorizes capital punishment
for a murderer, it has been legislated for safeguarding the sanctity
of human life.

# 2.4 The Unlawfulness of Killing Someone Who Accepts Islam in the midst of Fighting

Although the common notion expressed around the world is that
all is fair in love and war, Islam does not agree. It has laid down
rules and regulations for the battlefield, and the life and blessed
practice of the Prophet of Islam ﷺ enjoin us to observe caution,
care and fair play, even in the most critical and troubled moments
of war. The Prophet ﷺ showed his strong displeasure over the
killing of a man who declared his acceptance of the faith (which
*was* perhaps under the fear of death) when he was under the sword
and about to be slain. If that was his displeasure over someone
killed in a state of battle, what about killing Muslims and people
of knowledge only because their views differ with the extremist
ideologies of the rebel terrorist groups?

Usāma b. Zayd b. Ḥāritha ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) said,

> ‘The Messenger of God ﷺ dispatched us to fight against
Ḥuraqa, a branch of the Juhayna tribe, so we reached
the tribesmen in the morning and defeated them. One of
the *Anṣār* and I jointly caught up to a man of that tribe.
When we overpowered him, he said, “There is no god
but God”. Upon hearing this, the *Anṣārī* held back from
him, but I stabbed him with my spear until I killed him.
When we came back, the news had already reached the
Prophet ﷺ so he said to me, “O Usāma, did you kill him
after he said, ‘There is no god but God’?” I said, “O
Messenger of God, he was merely seeking refuge. (He
uttered the formula to save his life)!” He said again, “Did
you kill him after he said, ‘There is no god but God’?” He
kept repeating that to me, until I wished that I had not
embraced Islam before that day!’¹

The version of Imam Muslim reads:

> ‘So he ﷺ summoned him and asked him, “Why did you
kill him?” He said, “O Messenger of God, he caused pain
to the Muslims, and he killed so-and-so and so-and-so,
and I attacked him, so when he saw the sword, he said,
‘There is no god but God’!” The Messenger of God ﷺ
asked him, “Did you kill him?” When he said, “Yes”,
he said, “So how will you deal with ‘There is no god
but God’ when the Day of Resurrection comes?” He said,
“O Messenger of God, seek forgiveness on my behalf!”
He said again: “So how will you deal with ‘There is no
god but God’ when the Day of Resurrection comes?” He
then kept saying, without adding anything: “How will
you deal with ‘There is no god but God’ when the Day of
Resurrection comes?”’²

Miqdād b. Aswad ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) said,

> ‘I said to the Messenger of God, “What do you think,
if I meet a man of the disbelievers and we fight and he
strikes one of my hands with his sword and cuts it off and
then takes refuge from me behind a tree and says, ‘I have
surrendered to God’? Should I kill him, O Messenger of
God, after he has said that?” The Messenger of God ﷺ
said, “No. Do not kill him. If you were to kill him, then he
would be in your position [i.e., Muslim] before you killed
him and you would be in his position [i.e., disbeliever]
before he said that word which he said”.’³

In the light of these merciful and benevolent teachings of the
Prophet ﷺ, the brutal and ruthless terrorists, who indiscriminately
massacre peaceful Muslims, must ponder over and abandon their
misanthropist and barbaric ideologies and dreadful beliefs. If the
life of an enemy in the battlefield is protected when he accepts
faith, then how odious it is to massacre Muslims in mosques, and
how egregious it is to slay them in offices, educational institutes,
markets and public buildings!

# 2.5 Becoming an Accomplice to Terrorists is also a Crime

The Prophet ﷺ categorically forbade people to provide help or
material support to terrorists. He ordered us to isolate them and
deny them any numerical strength, financial assistance and moral
support. Abū Hurayra ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said,

> ‘If anyone helps in the murder of a believereven if with
only a few wordshe will meet God with the words
written on his forehead: “hopeless of God’s mercy”.’¹

This hadith also indicates that it is not only financial and
numerical assistance that must be denied to terrorists, but,
according to the expression ‘*bi shaṭri kalimatin*’ (‘a few words’),
speeches or writings which lend support to the enemies of peace
are also condemnable and must be banned. Such support can only
deprive us of God’s forgiveness and mercy. This hadith contains
a strict warning to those who mastermind terrorist acts and
misinterpret the Qurʾān by brainwashing youth with glad tidings
of Paradise for murdering peaceful civilians.

# 2.6 Those Who Attack Mosques Are the Greatest Wrongdoers

Islam not only teaches its adherents to maintain peace and observe
tolerance with other communities, but it also instils in them a
respect for the beliefs and viewpoints, and norms and rituals of
those who do not share their faith and creed. To launch attacks
against opponents, their properties and sacred sites on account of
religious, ideological or political differences is not only against
the express spirit of Islam but is inhumane as well. Those who
violate the sanctity of the houses of God and kill peaceful and
devout worshippers through bomb explosions and suicide attacks
are neither true believers nor people of guidance. Those who
hinder people from making mention of God’s name in mosques,
by spreading terror and intimidation, through violence and
terrorism are grave sinners and enemies of peace; the Qurʾān, in
fact, declares them the greatest wrongdoers and warns them of an
immense suffering in the Hereafter. God says,

> ‘*And who is more unjust than he who forbids the
remembrance of God’s name in the places of prostration*
[mosques] *and strives to demolish them? It was not
proper for them to enter the mosques but in a state of
fear* [fearing God]. *For them is disgrace in this world and
there is a dreadful torment for them in the Hereafter*’.¹

Elsewhere, God proclaims that those who maintain the houses
of worship are only those who believe in God and the Last Day;
it is they who are the guided ones. This implies that those people,
who, instead of maintaining the houses of worship, mount attacks
on them, believe neither in Islam nor in the Day of Judgement.
God says,

> ‘*Only he who believes in God and the Last Day and
establishes prayer and pays Zakat and who fears none but
God can maintain and frequent the mosques of God. So
they alone are expected to be amongst the rightly guided*’.²

Consider the life and company of the miscreants who violate
the sanctity of mosques and tombs of Muslim saints! With a
little thought, one will quickly discover that their ideological and
intellectual growth takes place in an atmosphere laden with narrow-
mindedness. This narrow-mindedness generates extremism, which
further leads to violence and aggression. And aggression takes its
logical shapethat being the monstrosity known as terrorism
which is the outcome of hatred, prejudice and violence, which
strip us of the qualities of love, peace, moderation and tolerance.
Such a person, in the words of the Qurʾān, becomes stone-hearted:

> ‘*Then* [even] *after this your hearts hardened. So* [in
hardness] *they* [have become] *like stones, or even harder*’.³

Such a person is the worst embodiment of wretchedness and
callous nihilism; he descends to a low level and takes the lives of
peaceful people in shops, markets, public places and educational
institutions. He sets himself loose on people engaged in worship
at mosques, and does not hesitate to tear down places of worship.
What do these terroristic acts have to do with Islam? Had there
been just a little fear of God and the Afterlife within such people,
at least the mosques would have been safe, and the Muslims busy
worshipping God would have been in peace. This mindset proves
that terrorists have no link with Islam, which is the religion of
peace, harmony, safety and tolerance.

# 2.7 Killing a Muslim is a Greater Sin than Destroying the World

How can wrongdoers who brutally kill peaceful citizens to realize
their vicious objectives claim to be the stalwarts of peace and
security? They are engaged in the wanton killing of thousands
of non-combatant Muslims through their terrorist activities;
however, the Prophet ﷺ declared that killing a Muslim is a greater
sin than destroying the whole world.

ʿAbd Allāh b. ʿAmr ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Messenger of God ﷺ
said,

> ‘Certainly, the passing away of the entire world is less in
the sight of God than the murder of a single Muslim’.¹

ʿAbd Allāh b. Burayda ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/104.jpg) reported from his father that the
Messenger of God ﷺ said,

> ‘Killing a believer is a more serious matter in the sight of
God than the destruction of the entire world’.²

Another report says the killing of a man, without legal
authority, is a tragedy more serious than the passing away of the
entire world. Al-Barāʾ b. ʿĀzib ![](http://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/107.jpg) reported that the Messenger of
God ﷺ said,
