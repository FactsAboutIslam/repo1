# The Meaning of Islam

## 1.1 Islam as Peace and Security

Islam is a religion of peace and security, and it urges others to pursue the path of peace and protection. The most significant proof of this is that God has named it as Islam.¹ The word Islam is derived from the Arabic word *salama* or *salima*. It means peace, security, safety and protection. As for its literal meaning, Islam denotes absolute peace. As a religion, it is peace incarnate. It encourages humankind to be moderate, peaceful, kind, balanced, tolerant, patient and forbearing.

If we look for the definition of a Muslim or *muʾmin* [believer] mentioned in the Qurʾān and hadith, it will become evident that, in the sight of God and His Messenger ﷺ, a Muslim is someone who embodies peace and security, and a *muʾmin* is the one who is endowed with love, affection, peace, tranquillity, tolerance and coexistence, and upholds the cause of human dignity. Everyone is protected and safe from him at all levels, individually and collectively.

3:19]; ‘*And I have chosen for you Islam as a* dīn’ [Qurʾān 5:3]; and ‘*He*
[God] *has named you Muslims in the previous* [Books] *as well as in this*
[Qurʾān]’ [Qurʾān 22:78].

## 1.2 The Three Levels of Islam

The Messenger of God a described three levels of religion: *Islām*,
*Imān* and *Iḥsān*. These are the levels of the religion applicable
to actions, beliefs and inner spiritual states. All Islamic teachings
revolve around these three levels, as proven by an agreed upon
hadith.
