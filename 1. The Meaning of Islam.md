# The Meaning of Islam
## 1.1 Islam as Peace and Security

Islam is a religion of peace and security, and it urges others to pursue the path of peace and protection. The most significant
proof of this is that God has named it as Islam.^1 The word Islam is derived from the Arabic word *salama* or *salima*. It means peace, security, safety and protection. As for its literal meaning, Islam denotes absolute peace. As a religion, it is peace incarnate. It encourages humankind to be moderate, peaceful, kind, balanced, tolerant, patient and forbearing.

If we look for the definition of a Muslim or mu√min [believer] mentioned in the Qur√¥n and hadith, it will become evident that,
in the sight of God and His Messenger a , a Muslim is someone who embodies peace and security, and a mu√min is the one who
is endowed with love, affection, peace, tranquillity, tolerance and coexistence, and upholds the cause of human dignity. Everyone is protected and safe from him at all levels, individually and collectively.
